Subject: Request to Wave off the bill

Hello AWS Team,

I am student and new to AWS and I Just started learning/exploring resources of different services available on AWS. Since I am not aware of the charges for the uses of resources and I am still learning the offerings, I would request to waive off the bill. I will make sure that I am utilizing the services and its resources judiciously in the future.

Thanks,
